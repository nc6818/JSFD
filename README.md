Learning JavaScript from JS all in one for Dummies.

## Usage

1. Include gamelet.js in an html document containing an element with an id of "ball"

```html
<div id="ball">@</div>
<script src="gamelet.js"></script>
```

2. The script will detect when the left or right arrow keys are pressed and will move the ball element accordingly.
